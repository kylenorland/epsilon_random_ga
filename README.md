# Experiments from Chapter 3: Epsilon Greedy Evaluation for Genetic Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning
Experimental code illustrating the benefits of introducing random actions for evaluation of genomes encoding reinforcement learning policies in sparse reward environments.

## Replication Instructions: Down Right Experiment
1. Clone repository
2. Using Miniconda, install the packages listed at the top of the manual_macro_frozen_ga_deap.py file.
3. Under "if generate_mode": near line 520, uncomment the type of experiment that you would like to run.
4. Note: Each present experiment type was used in the dissertation. New / alterative experiments can be based off of any of them. (Recommend mutation vs epsilon as a starting point)
5. Run the manual_macro_frozen_ga_deap.py file using python.
6. Results can be found in the results folder.
7. Changes to base parameters can be made by altering the "default_run" under default run settings (line 476)
